## Music creation app
* Our idea for a application is a music creation app that allows the user to recreate sounds of a instrument of their choice so we plan to have a homescreen and we will have a few options for instruments such as one for prcussion, piano, and ( another intrument goes here ) located in the homescreen which will be shown in the GIU mockup and when the user hovers over an instrument it will take them to a new place that has the instrument and intructions on how to make the sound.
- We think we can implement the sound aspect of this using keycodes such as the ones used in the calculator app so each key represents a sound
  - For example a piano that inputs each sound when you press the specific key
